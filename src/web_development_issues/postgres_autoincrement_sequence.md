# Postgres Duplicate Key Value Error

I imported a lot of data in one of my tables in postgresql , then I tried to insert another value via my back-end system. and it kept giving me `duplicate` key value violating error. I couldn't figure it out because I was able to insert data manually in my database. and then I asked ChatGPT to help me and this is the response.

Yeah, this is definitely an odd one, but I have a solid guess: it sounds like your **auto-increment sequence for the primary key (`id`) is out of sync** with the actual max `id` in your table. This happens when records are inserted manually or when something messes with the sequence.

### üîç **Troubleshooting & Fix**

Run this SQL query in PostgreSQL to check the **current max ID** and the **next value in the sequence**:

```sql
SELECT MAX(id) FROM users;
SELECT nextval('users_id_seq');
```

If `nextval` is **less than** `MAX(id)`, then your sequence is broken, and GORM is trying to insert an `id` that already exists, causing the **duplicate key error**.

#### ‚úÖ **Fix it by resetting the sequence**:

```sql
SELECT setval('users_id_seq', (SELECT MAX(id) FROM users));
```
This makes PostgreSQL correctly continue from the highest `id`.

### üîé **Possible Causes**

1. **Manual Inserts**: If you inserted records manually without specifying `DEFAULT`, they might not have updated the sequence.
2. **Truncation or Deletion**: If you deleted records and didn't reset the sequence, it could be misaligned.
3. **GORM Issue**: If you manually assigned IDs in Go (instead of letting the DB handle it), GORM might be trying to insert duplicate values.

### ‚ö° **GORM Best Practices to Avoid This**

When defining your `id`, make sure it's **auto-incrementing**:
```go
type User struct {
    ID    uint `gorm:"primaryKey;autoIncrement"`
    Email string `gorm:"unique"`
}
```
And when inserting:
```go
db.Create(&User{Email: "test@example.com"}) // Don't manually set ID
```
Let PostgreSQL handle the `id`.
